# Phaser Demo

Hi SEi36! I hope you guys enjoyed the Phaser demo and that you were able to (mostly) follow along.

If you have any questions you'd like to ask me please feel free to reach out in the mentor channel - my name is `bridget-mentor`.

And if you're keen on exploring Phaser further, have a look at [their website](https://phaser.io/). You can download the Javascript from the [download page](https://phaser.io/download/stable) and read through the [full tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part1) too, as well as look at their docs and code examples for a bunch of other games and animations.

Good luck for your final projects! I'll be tuning into the live stream :)
